This repository contains packaged binaries for my (closed source for now) AutoSV python project, which auto-generates excel flysheets for L-Acoustics and d&amp;b loudspeaker systems

## Go to "Releases" on the right hand side of this page for the latest version. 

## There's also a Wiki in this repository if you need any help.

# Description

One of the most unnecessarily time consuming tasks faced by the modern touring system engineer is writing out fly sheets so that their design can be easily flown on site. This process is typically done manually, perhaps taking 10 mins or more for a large show, and opens the process up to human error while you are transposing the values.

A few years back when I was touring with mostly L-Acoustics products, I began looking into ways of automating the process of generating my fly sheets using the report PDF that Soundvision produced.

It became somewhat of a hobby for me, and I dread to think how many hours (or indeed days) I’ve poured into the project since I started the codebase in 2019. I’ve learnt a lot about programming along the way, and the resulting program is something I’m quite proud of. Pretty soon I found myself thinking - now that I’ve done all the work, it would be a shame to keep the end product to myself.

So I’ve cautiously shared it around a few of my friends in the last couple of years, and between them they’ve helped me to iron out an overwhelming multitude of bugs and issues, and have gone on to encourage me to add a host of new features on top. 

I want to say a big thank you to everyone who has given it a go on their shows or sent in a bug/suggestion over the years – without you, AutoSV wouldn’t be what it is today, thank you for your patience. 

I’ve chosen to only release the compiled binaries at this time, as there’s still a few elements that I’m working on, and some new features in the pipeline.
